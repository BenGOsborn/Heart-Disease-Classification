# Heart disease EDA, classification and understanding

<br />

## This project features exploratory data analysis on the [heart disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), as well as a model that can predict if a patient has heart disease with an 84% accuracy on the validation set, and breaks down the importance of the features the model uses to make its predictions to help us better understand the factors that lead to heart disease.

<br />
